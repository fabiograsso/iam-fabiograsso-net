{{< figure src="/profile-small.webp" alt="Fabio" class="ma0 w-25 float-right" >}}

👋 I'm **Fabio Grasso**, a Solutions Engineer at Okta, specialized in **Identity & Access Management (IAM/CIAM)**. I work between **France** 🇫🇷 and **Italy** 🇮🇹, helping companies on their journey toward secure digital transformation.

## What I do

With passion and expertise, I support organizations in **strengthening their identity security**, with a special focus on **agile, scalable, and effective Zero Trust approaches**.

## I believe that…

* 🔐 Identity is the new security perimeter, and it's central to any Zero Trust strategy;
* 🌐 IAM solutions should be independent and based on open standards, avoiding vendor lock-in;
* 🚀 Companies must continuously evolve their security posture by integrating automation, governance, and behavioral analytics—as I do through my work with clients and technical conferences.

## Why this blog

In this space, I share my experience, ideas, and insights on **digital identity and cybersecurity**, exploring best practices, modern architectures, and real-world use cases. My goal is to provide valuable takeaways for those looking to turn identity management into a true strategic asset.

## 📣 Want to stay updated?
